## Demo
The first step to running these demos is to launch your own `tokenvm` Subnet. You
can do so by running the following command from this location (may take a few
minutes):
```bash
./scripts/run.sh;
```

_By default, this allocates all funds on the network to
`token1rvzhmceq997zntgvravfagsks6w0ryud3rylh4cdvayry0dl97nsjzf3yp`. The private
key for this address is
`0x323b1d8f4eed5f0da9da93071b034f2dce9d2d22692c172f3cb252a64ddfafd01b057de320297c29ad0c1f589ea216869cf1938d88c9fbd70d6748323dbf2fa7`.
For convenience, this key has is also stored at `demo.pk`._

To make it easy to interact with the `tokenvm`, we implemented the `token-cli`.
Next, you'll need to build this. You can use the following command from this location
to do so:
```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

_This command will put the compiled CLI in `./build/token-cli`._

Lastly, you'll need to add the chains you created and the default key to the
`token-cli`. You can use the following commands from this location to do so:
```bash
./build/token-cli key import demo.pk
./build/token-cli chain import-anr
```

_`chain import-anr` connects to the Avalanche Network Runner server running in
the background and pulls the URIs of all nodes tracking each chain you
created._

### Mint and Trade
#### Step 1: Create Your Asset
First up, let's create our own asset. You can do so by running the following
command from this location:
```bash
./build/token-cli action create-asset
```


#### Step 2: Mint Your Asset
After we've created our own asset, we can now mint some of it. You can do so by
running the following command from this location:
```bash
./build/token-cli action mint-asset
```

When you are done, the output should look something like this (usually easiest
just to mint to yourself).
```

#### Step 3: View Your Balance
Now, let's check that the mint worked right by checking our balance. You can do
so by running the following command from this location:
```bash
./build/token-cli key balance
```
